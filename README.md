# Mazie3D  
The Maize3D dataset includes two parts.  
One is for individual maize segmentation (Jin et al., 2018), which can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rj3IaoGjf3SjkFGx7OezeaaCuMDSogX6?usp=sharing.  
The dataset is used for stem and leaf segmentation (Jin et al., 2020), which can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1evGRk-sCeaDiSUXTGp1QWE1PJjqoBdBB?usp=drive_link  


# Readme for the individual maize segmentation dataset  
The training dataset includes 337 individual samples.  
The test dataset includes three sites, two of which are provided here.


# Read me for the stem and leaf segmentation dataset  
The training and validation dataset includes a whole dataset.  
x_y1_y2_idx_2277_withoutnoise.h5  


The testing dataset includes three parts from 3 months as below,  
x_y1_y2_idx_201706test.h5  
x_y1_y2_idx_201707test.h5  
x_y1_y2_idx_201708test.h5  



# Special Notes  
Since the corresponding data set was not sorted out in time after the article was published, some data were difficult to find in the past few years, resulting in some discrepancies between the data and the original text.  
We deeply regret this inconvenience.   
However, we believe some of the datasets still have great value for similar works.  
If you have any questions about the use of the data, please contact us.
